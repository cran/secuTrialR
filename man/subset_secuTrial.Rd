\title{Subsets a \code{secuTrialdata} object}
\usage{
subset_secuTrial(dat, participant = NULL, centre = NULL, exclude = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{\code{secuTrialdata} object containing participant IDs and centre information}

\item{participant}{character vector with a selection of participant IDs (mnpaid) used for subsetting}

\item{centre}{character vector with a selection of centre names (mnpctrname) used for subsetting}

\item{exclude}{boolean which if true excludes participants and centres from dat}
}
\value{
\code{secuTrialdata} object containing only those participants that meet the selection criteria.
}
\description{
Given a \code{secuTrialdata} object, and subsetting parameters,
this function filters the data object to include only the desired study participants.
Subsetting is possible based on participants and based on centres. In order to subset
based on participants, participant IDs (mnpaid) musst be present in the export.
In order to subset based on centres, centre information must be included in the export.
}
\details{
Subsetting based on participants only, centers only, or based on both is possible. The value of parameter exclude
determines whether the output will include participants that meet selection criteria (when exclude = FALSE),
or exclude them (when exclude = TRUE). When selecting based on both participants and centres,
exclude = FALSE will include the intersection of participants meeting the selection criteria.
If exclude = TRUE, a complement of union of participant and centre sets is returned.
